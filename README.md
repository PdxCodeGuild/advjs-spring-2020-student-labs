# Advanced Javascript Spring 2020 Student Folder

This is where students will turn in their work.

## How to turn in work

To practice real-world workflows, students are required to create new branches on git for their labs, and then open up a Pull Request when they want to "turn in" their work.

The instructor can then perform a Code Review and decide whether or not to merge in the students code, or whether to leave comments about how to clean things up. Once again, this is to practice a workflow that closely mimics industry practice.

Students are not allowed to directly push to master. They **must** open a pull request.

### Folder Structure

To organize your labs, create a new folder for the week (week-1, week-2, etc.) and then create a new folder inside there for your lab.

Example:

```
Evan-Hackett
└── week-1
   └── bat-belt
      └── bat-belt.js
```
